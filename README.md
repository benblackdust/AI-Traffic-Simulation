# AI-Traffic-Simulation
Traffic Signal Control Using AI - Project Summary This is a 7-week reinforcement learning project focused on developing an intelligent traffic light control system that optimizes traffic flow at intersections.
Project Goal
Create an AI agent that can control traffic signals more efficiently than traditional fixed-time controllers by learning from traffic patterns and adapting to changing conditions in real-time.
How It Works
The project uses reinforcement learning (similar to how AI learns to play games) to train a model that:

Observes traffic conditions (queue lengths, waiting times, vehicle counts)
Decides when to change traffic light phases
Receives rewards for reducing wait times and improving traffic flow
Learns optimal control strategies through trial and error in simulation

Project Phases
Weeks 1-2: Foundation

Set up traffic simulation environment (using tools like SUMO)
Create realistic 4-way intersection models with different traffic patterns
Design how the AI will "see" traffic and measure success

Weeks 3-4: AI Development

Build and train the reinforcement learning model
Implement the learning algorithm (DQN, A2C, etc.)
Create the training pipeline with progress tracking

Weeks 5-6: Testing & Refinement

Compare AI performance against traditional traffic controllers
Test on various scenarios (rush hour, normal conditions, incidents)
Optimize and enhance the model with advanced techniques

Week 7: Documentation & Presentation

Package the complete system with documentation
Create technical reports and performance analysis
Prepare demo and presentation materials

Expected Outcomes

A working AI traffic controller that outperforms fixed-time signals
Comprehensive performance metrics and analysis
Well-documented, portfolio-ready project with demo capabilities
